# instadog
My version of a simple Instagram clone, but for dogs!

## Built With
* [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/client)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) 

## Running the Application in Development Mode
**Step 1:** Clone the Repo

**Step 2:** Install all dependencies on the Frontend. Make sure you are in the root `instadog` folder  
`cd instadog`   
`npm install` 

**Step 3:** Next we need to install the GraphQL server dependencies. Make sure you are in the `server` folder  
`cd instadog/server`  
`npm install`

**Step 4:** Now we can start our backend server. Make sure you are still in the `server` folder  
`node server`

**Step 5:** Now we can run the frontend. Make sure you are in the root `instadog` folder  
`npm start`

Now  you should see the React App opened in your browser!
